				<p>Reservations are the most reliable revenue stream for many hotels, and they affect everything from profit margin to staffing. Ensuring that guests get the accommodations when they expect them is the easiest way for a hotel to reduce complaints and increase guest satisfaction.</p>
				<p>A well - organized reservation system allows hotels to ensure a steady flow of guests into their properties. Hotel chains offer their members the ability to fill 30 percent or more of available rooms on a nightly basis. Independent hoteliers have the onerous responsibility of creating exciting marketing programs to capture room business. Easy access to a hotel’s data bank of rooms helps in fulfilling the customers’ needs as well as in reaching a targeted daily occupancy rate, average daily rate, yield percentage, and RevPAR. A reservation system represents the primary means of producing positive cash flow and a favorable income statement</p>
				<p>An online booking system feeds a huge amount of guest data right into your system: how many guests are travelling, when they come, what amenities they prefer, where they live, and so forth. That’s very useful for you to know, and will help you improve both customer service and marketing.</p>
